# README

Arbitrage program demo using the web3.js library to implement interaction with DEXs running on the SmartBCH chain, such as `Benswap`, `Mistswap`, etc. It can also run on other EVM-compatible sidechains with a few modifications.

## Notice

This demo was created solely to share the arbitrage model. Please be cautious when running it in a production environment. There are still some issues that need to be resolved, such as the consensus problem.

## Strategy Summary

Based on `DEXDUELS_DEXES`, the program generates pairs of DEXs to attempt arbitrage. It works with different pairs of input and output tokens, generated by `BASE_SYMBOL` and `QUOTE_SYMBOLS`. Each pair of DEXs will attempt profitable swaps using the token pairs.

## Usage

- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
- Fill in the properties in the `.env.template` file as shown below, then rename it to `.env`:

  ```
  SMART_BCH_WSS=wss://smartbch-wss.greyh.at
  SMART_BCH_HTTPS=https://global.uat.cash
  QUOTE_SYMBOLS=EBEN,FLEX                   // Quotes for the arbitrage
  BASE_SYMBOL=WBCH                          // Base token for the arbitrage
  BASE_QTY=1                                // Amount of base token for the arbitrage
  INTERVAL=5000                             // Interval to check for opportunities
  TRIGGER_PROFIT_IN_USD=4                   // Profit required to trigger the arbitrage
  HTTP_PROXY=                               // Set proxy if your machine is configured with one
  DEXDUELS_DEXES=Benswap,Mistswap           // Names of DEXs that will participate in the arbitrage
  WALLET_ADDRESS=<YOUR WALLET ADDRESS>
  WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY>
  ```

- Run the program with `node dexduels.js`.- Run with `node dexduels.js`
